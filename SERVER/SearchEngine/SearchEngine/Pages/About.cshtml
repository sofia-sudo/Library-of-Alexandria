<h2>The Library</h2>
<p>The Library of Alexandria is a project started to combat the rise of misinformtion and internet censorship. We live in an age where it becomes increasingly difficult to tell what is true and what is false, all the while governments around the globe are tightening censorship laws and trying ever harder to keep their populations in the dark. We believe that reliable and accurate information should be easily accessible and free for everyone.</p>
<br />
<p>The Library is a search engine that crawls only trusted domains known to provide accurate, reliable and largely unbiased information. We also include censorship resistance tools to aid people in countries with active internet censorship.</p>
<br />

<h2>SecureLoad</h2>
<p>SecureLoad is a censorship resistance tool that allows people to access restricted content in their country. Here's how it works:</p>
<br />
<p>Instead of contacting the target sites server, a communication which is visible to your ISP and prone to interruption or interference, the target URL is encrypted and sent to our server. The Librarys server then contacts the target server anonymously and downloads the page you are attempting to visit. Our server then packages the page into a new .html file, strips the title and url and sends it back to your browser.</p>
<br />
<p>Using SecureLoad comes with several key benefits:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Neither your ISP nor your router cannot see that you have visited the site.</li>
    <li>The site will be displayed even if it is censored via IP or DNS blocking, provided the Librarys servers are not blocked themselves</li>
    <li>The site will not show up in your browser history.</li>
    <li>Once the page has finished sending to you, our server deletes all logs of the request and discards the HTML sent to your browser, therefore the fact that you ever visited this site is lost forever.</li>
    <li>Even if the Library is sued or ordered to hand over your information, we do not keep any records and thus have nothing to hand over, so your data will remain safe.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are however some limitations to using SecureLoad:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We do not maintain an active connection to the target site for privacy reasons, meaning you will access an offline version of the site.</li>
    <li>Multimedia content dependent on a proprietary or external CDN will not be accessible via SecureLoad</li>
    <li>Any links on the target site will either a) fail to load or b) take you outside of SecureLoad</li>
    <li>JavaScript can be used to identify your machine, therefore we block external scripts from running. In some fringe cases this may impact some features of the target site.</li>
</ul>
